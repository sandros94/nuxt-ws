There are only a few options to configure the Nuxt WebSocket module. They are all optional and you can set these options in your `nuxt.config.ts` file.

A complete example would look like this:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-ws'],

  ws: {
    route: '/_ws',
    topics: {
      defaults: ['session'],
      internals: ['_internal', 'notifications'],
    },
  }
})
```

## Options

::field-group
  ::field{name="route" type="string"}
    Defines the default route for `useWS` to connect to the WebSocket server. - Default to `undefined`
  ::

  ::field{name="topics.defaults" type="string[]"}
    Defines the topics that are automatically subscribed to when a connection is established. - Default to `[]`
  ::

  ::field{name="topics.internals" type="string[]"}
    Defines the topics that are considered internal and can only be listened to by the clients. Interactions with these are only possible via `hooks` - Default to `[]`
