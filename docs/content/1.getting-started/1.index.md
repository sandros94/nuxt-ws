This module aims to simplify the integration of WebSocket in Nuxt applications.

## Key Features

- 🔄 Automatic reconnection
- 📦 Built-in shared state management per-topic
- 🤖 Build-in validation with [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema)
- 🔐 Type-safe messages and topics
- 📢 Hooking system to trigger messages globaly
- ⛓️ Integrates easily with other Nuxt modules

## Composables and Utilities

There are available a number of client composables and server utilities. Used in conjunction we can achieve a seamless integration, but they can also be used independently.

### Client-Side

- `useWS`: A WebSocket implementation with built-in shared state management, topic subscriptions, and type safety.
- `useWSState`: A reactive state management based on Nuxt's `useState` to share state between components.

### Server-Side

- `defineWSHandler`: wraps Nitro's `defineWebSocketHandler` to provide additional configuration, hooks and automatic topic subscription.
